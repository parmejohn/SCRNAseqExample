## Running the .rmd file
Set working directory and plot outputs to desired path in line 17 to 18. Keep in mind that each single-cell RNA-seq experiment will use different parameters and this is using a raw unknown cell count. View the .html file to directly see results and coding blocks.

I have also included questions that were asked of me at the end and my answers for each one.
